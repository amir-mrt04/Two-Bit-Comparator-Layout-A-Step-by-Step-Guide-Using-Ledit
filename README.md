# Two-Bit-Comparator-Layout-A-Step-by-Step-Guide-Using-Ledit
 This project was part of the Advanced VLSI (AVLSI) course I took in Winter 2024 at the University of Guilan. It was a great learning experience under the guidance of Dr. Aminian, aimed at deepening my understanding of MOSFET transistors through hands-on circuit design using tools like Ledit.
